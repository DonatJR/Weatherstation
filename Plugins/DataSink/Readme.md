## Data Sink Plugins

Several data sink plugins exist. Each of them has its (possible) own configuration. Currently the following data sinks exists:

* <code>Console</code> - Simple print the measurement value information to the console
* <code>File</code> - Write the measurement value information to a file
* <code>LCD</code> - Print the measurement value information to the LCD bricklet of the weather station
* <code>MQTT</code> - Publish the measurement value information to a MQTT broker
* <code>SQLite</code> - Write the measurement value information to a SQLite databse

The data sink plugins can be used on client side as well as on server side.
