## Data Sink Plugins

Several data sink plugins exist. Each of them has its (possible) own configuration. Currently the following data sinks exists:

* <code>[Console](./Console/Readme.md)</code> - Simple print the measurement value information to the console
* <code>[File](./File/Readme.md)</code> - Write the measurement value information to a file
* <code>[LCD](./Lcd/Readme.md)</code> - Print the measurement value information to the LCD bricklet of the weather station
* <code>[MQTT](./MQTT/Readme.md)</code> - Publish the measurement value information to a MQTT broker
* <code>[SQLite](./SQLite/Readme.md)</code> - Write the measurement value information to a SQLite databse

Return to [main](./../../Readme.md).

## Remark

The data sink plugins can be used on client side as well as on server side.
